The following is a test of the scatter plot animation performance from a StackOverflow question.

The above answer runs at about 8FPS on my Linux desktop.

Modifying to create the scatter plot once and using set_offsets() to update the X/Y data gets it to about 15FPS.

Changing to blitting gets us to about 24FPS. 

Changing to blitting with the axes only being redrawn periodically when the limits change is marginally faster, about 179FPS.

In other testing I see that drawing the axes with the ticks and labels can consume up to 80 percent of draw time.

If the limits are not changing, then the axes do not need to be redrawn, only the actual data, which is by 
comparison very short.
